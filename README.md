# .spacemacs.d
spacemacs dot file(s)

[Download emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html) for your operating system. Test that it works. Try the tutorial.

Make sure you don't already have ~/.spacemacs.d before running this (but you should get a warning if you do):

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/durantschoon/.spacemacs.d.git .
```

Here's how to try using spacemacs if you already have a .emacs.d/ folder (from the [FAQ](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/doc/FAQ.org#try-spacemacs-without-modifying-my-existing-emacs-configuration)):

```
mkdir ~/spacemacs
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs.git ~/spacemacs/.emacs.d
HOME=~/spacemacs emacs
```

Or just install it to your ~/.emacs.d folder. Refer to the [origina repo](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs).

```
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

Launch emacs
